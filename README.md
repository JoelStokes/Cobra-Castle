## How to Play

The full game is available to play [Here at Itch.io](https://jstokesgames.itch.io/cobra-castle)!

Simply use the arrow keys to navigate through the floors of the castle. Hold down the Spacebar to sprint to catch tricky golden mice or speed through the early levels.
Every other room will alternate between eating enough mice to open an exit door or escaping through tricky passageways.

Try to rack up the highest score you can! But be careful, as the floors go up, the game gets faster and faster!
